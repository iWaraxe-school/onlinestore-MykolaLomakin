# Replace Faker with OpenAI API
Based on the code you've provided, here's a task description and step-by-step guide for the change you want to implement:

## Task Description:

The task is to modify the existing Faker library to use the OpenAI API instead for generating random but more relevant values. The OpenAI API is a more powerful tool that can generate more realistic and contextually relevant data. The task involves creating a request builder for the API calls, an OpenAI connector to facilitate communication with the OpenAI API, and implementing the OpenAI random product generator in the store populator class.

## Step-by-step Guide:

1. **RequestBuilder Class**: This class is used to build JSON objects to be sent to the OpenAI API. This class includes methods to set the model, prompt, max tokens, and temperature for the API call. The build method returns a JSON object with these properties.

2. **OpenAIConnector Class**: This class is responsible for making the actual API calls to the OpenAI API. It uses the RequestBuilder class to create the JSON objects to be sent to the API. This class also includes methods to generate a product name, product price, and product rate, which use the OpenAI API to generate these values based on the given prompts.

3. **OpenAIRandomProductGenerator Class**: This class uses the OpenAIConnector to generate a random product. It calls the methods in the OpenAIConnector class to generate a product name, price, and rate, and then creates a new product with these values.

4. **RandomStorePopulator Class**: This class is used to populate the store with random products. Instead of using the original RandomProductGenerator, it uses the OpenAIRandomProductGenerator to generate products. This class also includes a method to create categories for the store and a method to fill the store with random products.

## Additional Notes:

- Ensure to replace the `ORGANIZATION_KEY` and `API_KEY` in the `OpenAIConnector` class with your actual OpenAI keys.
- The OpenAI API usage may incur costs. Be sure to understand OpenAI's pricing model and adjust the usage accordingly.
- The `MAX_TOKENS` and `TEMPERATURE` values in the `OpenAIConnector` class may need to be tweaked depending on the desired trade-off between randomness and relevance.
- Make sure to handle exceptions properly and add necessary validations where required.
- Always consider the security of your API keys. Never expose them in a public or insecure environment.
